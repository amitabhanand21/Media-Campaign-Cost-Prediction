# Media-Campaign-Cost-Prediction
Tabular Regression with a Media Campaign Cost Dataset (Kaggle competion)
# The task at hand is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the cost of media campaigns in food marts.
The dataset provided has 16 columns which contain various features that can potentially affect the cost of media campaigns in food marts. These features include store sales, unit sales, household characteristics such as the number of children and cars at home, the weight of the food item, packaging type, low-fat options, units per case, store area, and availability of various facilities such as coffee bars, video stores, salad bars, prepared food, and florist shelves. The target variable or dependent variable is the cost of acquiring a customer in dollars, which is the column named "Cost" in the dataset.

The first two columns of the dataset, store_sales and unit_sales, provide information on the sales generated by the store and the quantity of items sold in the store, respectively. These columns may help in understanding the business potential of the store and the demand for the products sold in the store.

The columns Total_children and Num_children_at_home provide information on the number of children in the household. This information may help in understanding the target audience of the media campaigns and how to tailor them accordingly.

The column avg_cars_at_home(approx) provides information on the approximate number of cars owned by the customer. This information may help in understanding the socio-economic status of the target audience and how to design the media campaigns accordingly.

The column Gross_weight provides information on the weight of the food item. This information may help in understanding the packaging and transportation costs of the food item and how it may affect the overall cost of the media campaign.

The columns Recyclable_package and Low_fat provide information on the packaging type and whether the food item is a low-fat option or not. This information may help in understanding the sustainability and health-consciousness of the target audience and how to design the media campaigns accordingly.

The column Units_per_case provides information on the number of units available in each case on the store shelves. This information may help in understanding the stocking capacity of the store and how it may affect the overall cost of the media campaign.

The column Store_sqft provides information on the area of the store available in square feet. This information may help in understanding the size and capacity of the store and how it may affect the overall cost of the media campaign.

The columns Coffee_bar, Video_store, Salad_bar, Prepared_food, and Florist provide information on the facilities available in the store. This information may help in understanding the customer experience of the store and how it may affect the overall cost of the media campaign.

The column Cost provides information on the cost incurred on acquiring a customer in dollars. This column is the target variable or dependent variable of the machine learning model. The goal of the machine learning model is to predict this target variable based on the given features.
